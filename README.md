# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Introduction
This project explores the Starbucks Capstone Challenge, using a simulated dataset to analyze customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The goal is to determine how different demographic groups respond to various types of offers.

## Files Overview

### 1. `portfolio.json`
- Offer IDs and metadata.
- **Variables:**
  - `id` (string) - offer ID
  - `offer_type` (string) - type of offer (BOGO, discount, informational)
  - `difficulty` (int) - minimum required spend
  - `reward` (int) - reward for completing
  - `duration` (int) - time offer is open
  - `channels` (list of strings)

### 2. `profile.json`
- Demographic data for each customer.
- **Variables:**
  - `age` (int) - age of the customer
  - `became_member_on` (int) - date when customer created an app account
  - `gender` (str) - gender of the customer
  - `id` (str) - customer ID
  - `income` (float) - customer's income

### 3. `transcript.json`
- Records for transactions, offers received, viewed, and completed.
- **Variables:**
  - `event` (str) - record description
  - `person` (str) - customer ID
  - `time` (int) - time in hours
  - `value` (dict of strings) - offer ID or transaction amount

## Problem Statement
Starbucks aims to optimize offer targeting and customer engagement. The challenge is to determine which demographic groups respond best to specific offer types. Customers not explicitly opting into offers adds complexity.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Addressing issues related to users not opting into offers.
- Handling demographic variations and user purchases without receiving or viewing offers.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
- Identifying significant features influencing offer completion.

### 3. Model Building (Optional)
- Utilizing machine learning models for predicting user responses.
- Assessing models such as RandomForest and GradientBoosting.

### 4. Results and Recommendations
- Presenting findings and actionable insights.
- Recommending strategies for effective offer targeting.
